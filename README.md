Procedural terain generator using perlin noise for unity

This was a failed atempt of create something like dwarf fortress in 3d. I got this nice procedural generator that is kind of optimized (Works in my machine :D).
It can create lots of levels on the underground and also you can check the y levels(z levels for DF players)  with the mouse wheel.
